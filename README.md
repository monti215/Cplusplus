Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I decided to submit the multiplication table for this assignment, and it solved the problem of displaying a multiplication table for users to learn math.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe the code itself looks really clean and organized.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have used more in-line comments for the lines of code to better understand which function does what.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did not particularly find anything too challenging about this one, it was a pretty straight forward code to work on.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Using case instead of if/else I think. It made things alot easier to write it this way. I can definitely see pretty much every single project in the future will use these terms.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To me, it is all about the spacing and indenting of code. If it looks neat and organized, it is much easier to follow, but also a simple wrong indentation can make your code not function properly.
